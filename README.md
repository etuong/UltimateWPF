# Ultimate WPF

This is a series of examples in Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).

The first two examples are on animation. The first animation manipulates the user's action such as the mousedown event to change the control's properties. The second animation uses a storyboard to change the opacity of two overlaying images. 

The third example touches on basic styling such as typing in a literal color text to change the background. It has a variety of use cases on the style triggers.

The fourth example shows how to use the data template to dynamically bind properties. 

The fifth example demonstrates how to use the control template.

Finally, we end with the last example that combines all of our knowledge to make explosive fireworks!
